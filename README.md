# Minesweeper

Intended to become a chrome extension where you can play minesweeper. Join me on my journey as I try to learn some functional programming (excuse my bad practices, pull requests are welcome)

# Todo

-   [ ] Overlay

    -   [ ] Settings

-   [ ] Open / flag cells (finished in main branch, do in more functional manner)

-   [ ] Display bomb / flag images
